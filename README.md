# QJournalctl v0.2
### A Qt-based Graphical User Interface for systemd's journalctl command 



#### About QJournalctl 
systemd provides `journalctl` to display and analyze its journal. Think of
the journal as a giant log file for the whole system. Different programs
(like KDE Apps, but also the kernel) write their log entries into systemd's
journal. journalctl supports a few flags/parameters to specify what should
be displayed. QJournalctl is just a graphical user interface which displays
the journal and lets the user simply change the parameters to check the log
for specific reports or errors.
