## About QJournalctl
systemd provides `journalctl` to display and analyze its journal. Think of
the journal as a giant log file for the whole system. Different programs
(like e.g. different software/services on your system, but also the kernel) write their log entries into systemd's
journal. journalctl supports a few flags/parameters to specify what should
be displayed. QJournalctl is just a graphical user interface which displays
the journal and lets the user simply change the parameters to check the log
quickly for specific reports or errors.

## QJournalctl for Linux

### ArchLinux and Manjaro
QJournalctl is available in the community repository of **Archlinux** and **Manjaro**:

```bash
sudo pacman -S qjournalctl
```
For other distributions, it is at the moment required to build it from sources.

### General build dependencies
* Make sure your compiler supports (at least) C++11 (E.g. `g++` ≥ 4.8.1, `clang` ≥ 3.3)
* QJournalctl relies on Qt5, please ensure to have the Qt5 development libraries installed, when compiling! (E.g. `qtbase5-dev` for Debian/Ubuntu; on macOS these come with the `qt` Homebrew tap)
* To access remote hosts QJournalctl heavily relies on `libssh` ≥ [0.8.7](https://www.libssh.org/files/0.8/)

### How to install build dependencies (on Debian-based distributions) 
Your distribution's supplied version of `libssh` might be too old for a successful build. You need
to build and install libssh yourself (< 2 minutes!)

`sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev cmake libssl-dev pkg-config`

`wget https://www.libssh.org/files/0.9/libssh-0.9.5.tar.xz`

`tar xf libssh-0.9.5.tar.xz ; cd libssh-0.9.5`

`mkdir build ; cd build`

`cmake .. && sudo make install`

`cd ../..`

### How to build and install QJournalctl
1. Download the source code and extract it (or use `git clone https://github.com/pentix/qjournalctl.git`)
2. Run `./autogen.sh`
3. Run `make -j$(nproc)` to compile qjournalctl
4. Run `sudo make install`  



## QJournalctl for macOS
### Build dependencies
To handle dependencies of macOS, we're going to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
`brew install qt libssh`
As indicated in the caveats:

````
qt is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because Qt 5 has CMake issues when linked.

If you need to have qt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/user_name/.bash_profile
````

before building QJournalctl you'll indeed need to run:
`export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"`
(no need to make it persistent by using .bash_profile)


### How to build and install QJournalctl
1. Download the source code and extract it (or use `git clone https://github.com/pentix/qjournalctl.git`)
2. Run `./autogen.sh`
3. Run `make -j$(nproc)` to compile qjournalctl
4. Run `sudo make install`  


## QJournalctl for Windows

### Build dependencies

To build QJournalctl for Windows, it is needed
- MSVC 2017 C++ Build Tools for x64/x86 (>= `v141`). They are part of the Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 and can be also installed in the version 2019 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=vs-2019)
- Qt >= `5.13.2`
- vcpkg >= `2020.01` (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

### Installing `vcpkg`
1. Checkout the vcpkg github repository within the folder of the `qjournalctl` repository (`<qjournalctlfoldr>/vcpkg/`) from https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
2. Open a `cmd` and go to `<qjournalctlfoldr>/vcpkg/`
3. run `./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`. With this, you will get vcpkg ready to be used

### Install the QJournalctl dependencies
`QJournalctl` is based on `libssh`. It is possible to obtain it using `vcpkg`:
1. Navigate to the `vcpkg` folder (`<qjournalctlfoldr>/vcpkg/`)
2. Get the `libssh` dependencies for the target needed:
```
vcpkg install libssh:x64-windows
```

Now, the `libssh` binaries as well as its dependencies can be found at `<repository_root>/vcpkg/packages/`

### Building QJournalctl

It is possible to build `QJournalctl` using two different manners
- Using QtCreator. 
- Using the `autogen_and_build.bat` script.

#### Build using `autogen_and_build.bat`
Considering that the *Install the QJournalctl Dependencies* steps are already performed, first adjust `autogen_and_build.bat` with your own paths
- Set the value of `ARCH` to either `x86` to compile for a x86 32 bit target or to `x86_64` for a x86 64 bit target  
- Modify the variable `VCPKG_INSTALL_FOLDER` defined in the `autogen_and_build.bat` with the path where you have vcpkg, (i.e. set `VCPKG_INSTALL_FOLDER= <yourqjournalctlrepopath>\vcpkg`)
- Modify the path where Qt for the given toolchain path is found (`QTDIR` may be for instance `C:\Qt\Qt5.14.1\5.14.1\msvc2017_64`)
- Run `autogen_and_build.bat`. The application can be found at `release/` folder.

#### Build using QtCreator
First, it is needed to configure QtCreator by enabling the MSVC toolchain. Configure it for 32 and 64 bit, release and debug by navigating to `Projects > Manage Kits > add ...`

Once it is set up 
- Click in the "screen" icon and select the MSVC 2017 64 bit release configuration
- Now, Start the build process using `Build > Build project "qjournalctl"`
